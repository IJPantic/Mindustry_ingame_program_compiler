goto(point,condition); 		#jumps to a point in code if condition is met
point(name);				#declares a point in code that doesn't depend on index of code line
var(name,value);			#declares new variable and sets it to a value (or changes already existing one
op(operation,a,b,result);	#does operation on 2 variables and saves it to a result variable
input1b(a,switchName);		#inputs a state of a switch into a variable
printf(a,messageName);		#prints 'a' to a selected message block 

BTW: for 'condition' and 'operation' arguments use instructions that are already included in mindustry instruction set
