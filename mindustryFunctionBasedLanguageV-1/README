free use and edit for whatever you want

Intructions for use:
	1. run program
	2. enter name of a file where will program write compiled mindustry code to
	3. enter name of a file where is function-based code written
	4. if successful, program will output 'DONE!' to a terminal (after that you can close program)

Syntax rules for function-based language:
	functionName(argument);
	if function has multiple arguments:
		functionName(argument0,argument1,argumentN);
	function name can include every ascii character expect:
		'(' (if possible dont use ')' either because it will be hard to read)
		';'
	name of arguments can inlude any ascii character expect:
		','
		')' (if possible dont use '(' either because it will be hard to read)
		';'

Rules and instructions for adding a new function for function-based langauge:
	1. add your function name and it's lenght in 'instructionLenght' dictionary (name of function must not be any function that is built-in python, like 'print' for example)
	2. add your new function to '#TODO: add your new functions here' section following rules as already included ones
	3. save and exit file after adding new function and run program (test for errors first time)
